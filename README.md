This is a translation of a school project I did in 2016 from java to python.
Includes TicTacToe.java and TicTacToe.py
OCT-20-2018
Initial Push. Started translation, still a mix of java and python will not compile. Java file compiles
OCT-21-2018
Second Push. Changed tracker of board from 3d array to dictionary. Organized to split the 
python from the java. 
OCT-29-2018
Figured out the usage of the "sums" variable in Java. Can use dictionary and tuple array instead.
